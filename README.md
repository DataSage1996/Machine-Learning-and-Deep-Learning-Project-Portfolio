First Project Title: Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

This project aims to develop a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from Kaggle is used for analysis. The project begins with data preparation and cleaning, utilizing Python programming language for data mining and manipulation. The dataset is thoroughly examined to address missing values and inconsistencies, ensuring reliable results. The logistic regression algorithm is implemented using Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. The model is trained on the prepared dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, fitting it, and evaluating its performance on the testing data. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score provide insights into the model's ability to classify cancerous and non-cancerous patients. The results are interpreted and analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of the model's predictive capabilities. Python programming skills are utilized throughout the project, showcasing my proficiency in cancer prediction, machine learning, and data mining techniques.
