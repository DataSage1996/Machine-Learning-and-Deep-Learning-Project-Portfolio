First Project Title: Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

This project aims to develop a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from Kaggle is used for analysis. The project begins with data preparation and cleaning, utilizing the Python programming language for data mining and manipulation. The dataset is thoroughly examined to address missing values and inconsistencies, ensuring reliable results. The logistic regression algorithm is implemented using Scikit-learn, a popular machine-learning library in Python. The model is trained on the prepared dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, fitting it, and evaluating its performance on the testing data. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score provide insights into the model's ability to classify cancerous and non-cancerous patients. The results are interpreted and analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of the model's predictive capabilities. Python programming skills are utilized throughout the project, showcasing my proficiency in cancer prediction, machine learning, and data mining techniques.

Second Project Title: K-Means Clustering 101: World Happiness Report

This case study/project aims to train an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to cluster countries based on factors contributing to happiness. The World Happiness Report provides valuable insights into global happiness, with individuals ranking their lives on a scale from 0 to 10. The project utilizes the Python programming language and libraries to analyze and visualize the data, with Jupyter Notebook serving as the development environment for code implementation and documentation. The main steps of the project include data collection, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, unsupervised learning, evaluation and interpretation, visualization, and documentation. The project provides valuable experience in unsupervised machine learning, data analysis, and visualization, while the clustering results offer a meaningful perspective on factors influencing happiness across different countries. 

Third Project Title: Emotion AI: Facial Key-points Detection (CNN and RNN)

This project explores deep learning theory and intuition, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Neural Networks. It aims to develop a deep learning model that accurately classifies images from a dataset. The project uses essential libraries like Keras and TensorFlow 2.0 as the backend and visualizes images to gain insights. Data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance the model's generalization capability and increase the dataset size. CNNs are effective for image classification tasks due to their ability to learn hierarchical representations from the image data. Residual networks address the problem of vanishing gradients, allowing for deeper networks to be trained effectively. The model is compiled and fitted to the training data, and its performance is assessed using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Regularization techniques like dropout are implemented to enhance the network's performance and reduce overfitting. The project concludes by showcasing the trained CNN and its improved performance through regularization techniques.

Fourth Project Title: Unsupervised Machine Learning for Customer Market Segmentation (KMeans Clustering, Elbow Method, PCA)

The project aims to develop a customer market segmentation solution using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Utilizing AI and machine learning techniques (KMeans Clustering, Elbow Method, PCA), it automates the process, identifying patterns, similarities, and relationships in customer data. Implemented using Python programming and Jupyter Notebook, the project follows a systematic workflow, analyzing and interpreting customer segments for insights into characteristics, behaviors, and preferences. Evaluating the segmentation model's performance and robustness using metrics like silhouette score and the within-cluster sum of squares.

Fifth Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to build a machine-learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions accurately. The project utilizes a dataset containing anonymized credit card transactions, where each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent or genuine. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a small fraction of fraud cases compared to genuine cases.This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. It involves data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, data splitting, handling class imbalance, model selection, training and evaluation, model comparison and selection, and final model evaluation. The project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions and provides hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and visualization. The best-performing model or combination of models is selected for the credit card fraud detection task. By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and visualization, as well as dealing with class imbalance and implementing various machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.
