First Project Title: Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

This project aims to develop a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from Kaggle is used for analysis. The project begins with data preparation and cleaning, utilizing the Python programming language for data mining and manipulation. The dataset is thoroughly examined to address missing values and inconsistencies, ensuring reliable results. The logistic regression algorithm is implemented using Scikit-learn, a popular machine-learning library in Python. The model is trained on the prepared dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, fitting it, and evaluating its performance on the testing data. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score provide insights into the model's ability to classify cancerous and non-cancerous patients. The results are interpreted and analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of the model's predictive capabilities. Python programming skills are utilized throughout the project, showcasing my proficiency in cancer prediction, machine learning, and data mining techniques.

Second Project Title: K-Means Clustering 101: World Happiness Report

This case study/project aims to train an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to cluster countries based on factors contributing to happiness. The World Happiness Report provides valuable insights into global happiness, with individuals ranking their lives on a scale from 0 to 10. The project utilizes the Python programming language and libraries to analyze and visualize the data, with Jupyter Notebook serving as the development environment for code implementation and documentation. The main steps of the project include data collection, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, unsupervised learning, evaluation and interpretation, visualization, and documentation. The project provides valuable experience in unsupervised machine learning, data analysis, and visualization, while the clustering results offer a meaningful perspective on factors influencing happiness across different countries. 

Third Project Title: Emotion AI: Facial Key-points Detection

This project explores deep learning theory and intuition, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Neural Networks. It aims to develop a deep learning model that accurately classifies images from a dataset. The project uses essential libraries like Keras and TensorFlow 2.0 as the backend and visualizes images to gain insights. Data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance the model's generalization capability and increase the dataset size. CNNs are effective for image classification tasks due to their ability to learn hierarchical representations from the image data. Residual networks address the problem of vanishing gradients, allowing for deeper networks to be trained effectively. The model is compiled and fitted to the training data, and its performance is assessed using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Regularization techniques like dropout are implemented to enhance the network's performance and reduce overfitting. The project concludes by showcasing the trained CNN and its improved performance through regularization techniques.
